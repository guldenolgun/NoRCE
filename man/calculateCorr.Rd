\title{Calculates the correlation coefficient values between two custom
expression data.}
\usage{
calculateCorr(
  exp1,
  exp2,
  label1 = "",
  label2 = "",
  corrMethod = "pearson",
  varCutoff = 0.0025,
  corCutoff = 0.3,
  pcut = 0.05,
  alternate = "greater",
  conf = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp1}{Custom expression data matrix or SummarizedExperiment data.
Columns must be genes and rows must be patients.}

\item{exp2}{Custom expression data matrix or SummarizedExperiment data.
Columns must be genes and rows must be patients.}

\item{label1}{Gene names of the custom exp1 expression data. If it is
not provided, column name of the exp1 data will be taken.}

\item{label2}{Gene names of the custom exp2 expression data. If it is
not provided, column name of the exp2 data will be taken.}

\item{corrMethod}{Correlation coeffient method that will be used for
evaluation. Possible values are "pearson", "kendall", "spearman"}

\item{varCutoff}{Variance cut off that genes have less variance than
this value will be trimmed}

\item{corCutoff}{Correlation cut off values for the given correlation
method}

\item{pcut}{P-value cut off for the correlation values}

\item{alternate}{Holds the alternative hypothesis and "two.sided",
"greater" or "less" are the possible values.}

\item{conf}{Confidence level for the returned confidence interval. It is
only used for the Pearson correlation coefficient if there are at least
4 complete pairs of observations.}
}
\value{
Pairwise relations between gene-gene with corresponding correlation
      value and pvalue
}
\description{
Calculates the correlation coefficient values between two custom
expression data.

#Assume that mirnanorce and mrnanorce are custom patient by gene data
a<-calculateCorr(exp1 = mirna, exp2 = mrna )
