\title{Extract the genes that have user provided biotypes. This method is useful 
when input gene list is mixed or when research of the interest is only

\arguments{
\item{gtfFile}{Input gtf file for the genes provided by the extractBiotype
function}

\item{biotypes}{Selected biotypes for the genes}
}
\value{
Table format of genes with a given biotypes
}
