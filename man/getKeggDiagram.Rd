\title{Display the enriched KEGG diagram of the KEGG pathway. This function is
specific to only one KEGG pathway id and identifies the enriched genes
in the diagram.}
\usage{
getKeggDiagram(mrnaObject, pathway, org_assembly = c("hg19", "hg38",
  "mm10", "dre10", "rn6", "dm6", "ce11", "sc3"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mrnaObject}{Output of enrichment results}

\item{pathway}{Kegg pathway term such as 'hsa04010'}

\item{org_assembly}{Genome assembly of interest for the analysis.
Possible assemblies are "mm10" for mouse, "dre10" for zebrafish,
"rn6" for rat, "dm6" for fruit fly, "ce11" for worm, "sc3" for yeast,
"hg19" and "hg38" for human}
}
\value{
Shows kegg diagram marked with an enriched genes in a browser
